Today we had the first meeting for our project. Hugi suggested us to use Github and PyCharm as the programming tool for this project.
We all agreed to him. Using Github, all group members can share and edit the codes without messing them. Sometimes, we do not know 
which one is most updated version and Github can help us solve this problem. We scheduled several meetings afterhand so that we can 
discuss and exchange ideas. This is the first time for both Tobias and me to deal with Github, Hugi was really nice that he gave us 
a small tutorial about Github (pull and push request). This is also my first time dealing with programming, hopefully, I can make it
and I believe I can learn many programming skills in this project.

We had the project instuction from Olof, and the following is the brief summary of our project.

Title:The effect of subsampling of large RNA-seq data sets on gene expression analysis

Objective: 1. To find differentially expressed (DE) genes between inflammatory and noninflammatory human blood

           2. Investigate the allelic bias for the individual samples
           
Data: Blood samples from 8 individuals, 2 samples per individual.

      For each individual, one part of each sample was treated by LPS and one part was left untreated, thus resulting in 16 samples.
      
      8 samples treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and 8 untreated in order to get an inflammatory response.
      
Hypothesis: Deep sequencing impairs the finding of the DE genes.

Random sub samplings will be performed where only ~30-75% of the total data will be used in order to see how it affects the results.
