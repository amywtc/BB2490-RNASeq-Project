Today we had the first meeting for our project. Hugi suggested us to use Github and PyCharm as the programming tool for this project.
We all agreed to him. Using Github, all group members can share and edit the codes without messing them. Sometimes, we do not know 
which one is most updated version and Github can help us solve this problem. We scheduled several meetings afterhand so that we can 
discuss and exchange ideas. This is the first time for both Tobias and me to deal with Github, Hugi was really nice that he gave us 
a small tutorial about Github (pull and push request). This is also my first time dealing with programming, hopefully, I can make it
and I believe I can learn many programming skills in this project.
